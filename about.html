                    <p>
                        As a senior product designer with over 9 years of experience, I'm focused on creating
                        user-friendly and impactful digital products. My goal is always to design things that truly
                        solve user problems and also bring value to the business. <strong>My expertise also extends to
                        DesignOps,
                        where I've successfully planned and implemented various design guidelines and design systems to
                        streamline workflows and ensure design consistency.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the past three years, I've worked as a Senior Product Designer at Dcard (Taiwan's leading
                        social media platform). My main focus there has been on driving user growth and enhancing the
                        creator ecosystem. Before Dcard, I designed for several well-known companies in the financial
                        sector, including Cathay Financial Holdings (ÂúãÊ≥∞ÈáëÊéß-Êï∏Êï∏Áôº),
                        Anue FundInvestment (ÈâÖ‰∫®Á∂≤), and E.SUN Financial Holdings (ÁéâÂ±±ÈáëÊéß), gaining valuable experience across diverse
                        industries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey into design started differently. When I was a child, I really enjoyed doodling and
                        creating things, but I never thought it would become my career. It was during my college studies
                        in Library and Information Science at National Taiwan University that I discovered user
                        experience (UX) concepts, and they immediately caught my interest. I took courses in psychology
                        and knowledge management, and even got a Knowledge Management Program Certificate. After a short
                        time working as a marketing associate, I realized it wasn't the path for me. That's when I
                        decided to teach myself design. I started by designing Line stickers and campaign pages. My
                        marketing background actually helped a lot, as it gave me a better understanding of users. This,
                        combined with my strong enthusiasm for learning, helped me become a product designer. <strong>My
                        commitment to continuous learning also extends to leveraging modern tools like AI for coding,
                        which helps me enhance my design workflow and improve collaboration with developers.</strong>

                        Outside of work, I enjoy reading novels, which helps me find balance. I also love traveling,
                        and Japan is my favorite country. These personal interests help me relax and also give me new
                        perspectives on people and different cultures.
