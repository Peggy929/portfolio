      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Dcard is a well-known social media platform in Taiwan with a large user base. Although it is a mature product,
        there are some issues within Dcard's design system, one of which is the lack of a unified color system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, each of the three platforms (web, iOS, Android) had its own color system, leading to many
        inconsistencies. For example, certain colors were different across platforms, or the same color code had
        different names on each platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        This resulted in some color differences in Dcard's interfaces across different platforms.

      <h2>How to promote? What Did I Do?

      </h2>
      <p>Unifying the colors across three platforms involved extensive cross-team communication and coordination.
        Therefore, I decided to prepare privately and seek allies to push for integration.

      </p>
      <p>Coincidentally, Figma introduced the variables feature in 2023, which provided an excellent opportunity. I
        created a preliminary version and showcased it to some colleagues, demonstrating the benefits of unified colors
        and the one-click switching between Light mode & Dark mode. I found some partners, L and H, and thus began the
        promotion of the New Color System.

      </p>
      <p>The entire promotion process can be divided into the following stages:

        <p>We applied these unified colors to the main pages to see if the new colors could fit well. After that, we
          produced the first version and prepared to seek support from higher-ups and promote it to other partners.

      <p>During this phase, we created a comparison table of the old and new versions for the developers to use. Before
        formal implementation, H and I applied the new color system to components in the design guidelines for all three
        platforms. This served as a template for our partners and reduced inconvenience for them.

      <h2>Difficulties and Challenges


      </h2>
      <p>Aside from the complex task of integrating three inconsistent color systems into one unified system, the
        optimization effort also spanned multiple departments, making communication and coordination a significant
        challenge.

      </p>
      <p>During the development and application phase, we discovered that the previous use of colors had not been
        rigorous enough. Additionally, there were often discrepancies between the actual products and the design drafts.
        Therefore, during the application phase, the Color System still required many additional adjustments.

      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, both H and I had existing responsibilities within our respective development teams. This meant
        that while promoting the New Color System, we had to balance our ongoing tasks. Consequently, the promotion
        process frequently needed to be paused.

      <p>About two months after the new colors were launched, I conducted a satisfaction survey to assess the impact of
        this optimization. The results were as follows:

      <ol class="con-list">
        <li>Greatly accelerated the production of design drafts, with a satisfaction rate of 100%

          Automated switching between Dark and Light modes, with a satisfaction rate of 96.7%
        </li>
        <li> Unified the colors across all three platforms, improving product consistency, with a success rate of 100%
