      <p>Cathay Healthcare Management is top 5 Healthcare Center in Taiwan, and serves more than 100,000 times a year.
        However, there is no way to book a reservation online. The only one way is to make a phone call, which causes a
        lot of pain for both clients and staffs.

      </p>
      <p>And, it’s hard when it comes to health tracking, clients can’t know the meaning of the various data points
        related to his health after all the examination.

      <p>Clients will get their health report in two weeks after finishing all the examinations. They can check it

      <p>Since this platform was built from zero, there were really a lot of great experiences to learn. However the
        most special experience most be transforming paper works to digital. </p>

      <img src="../img/Cathay Health care/HC_2.png" alt="Description" class="block-image ">
      <p>There were a lot of forms that every client used to sign or fill out in the hospital when they checked in on
        the examination day. We found that clients always spent a lot of time filling out those forms, so the check-in
        desk was always full of people.</p>
      <p>To improve this situation, I thought: why not let them fill out those forms online and before they go to the
        hospital? Therefore, I started to transform those paper forms and questionnaires into digital ones.</p>
      <p>It took me a lot of time to think about how to present those forms from paper to digital, especially the Body
        Pain Form. I designed a lot of versions for the Body Pain Form and finally created an amazing version that
        received 100% positive feedback. It was totally worth it!</p>
